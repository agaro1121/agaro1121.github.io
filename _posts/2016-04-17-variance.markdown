Hi everyone. I'm back with another one of my posts :-)

Today I want to write about a topic that isn't new but is still interesting, Variance.

There are three(3) types of Variance. I'll go over the three of them below with examples.

Covariant
Contravariant
Invariant

TODO:
- what is variance
- use cases
- define terms
- how it relates to java array issues
- how it relates to polymorphism
- how it relates to scala type classes?

Examples:
- Parent, child, grandchild
